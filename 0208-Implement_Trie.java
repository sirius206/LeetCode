/*
With my solution I took the simple approach of giving each TrieNode a 26 element array of each possible child node it may have. 
I only gave 26 children nodes because we are only working with lowercase 'a' - 'z'. If you are uncertain why I made the root of my Trie 
an empty character this is a standard/typical approach for building out a Trie it is somewhat arbitrary what the root node is.
For insert I used the following algorithm. Loop through each character in the word being inserted check if the character is a 
child node of the current TrieNode i.e. check if the array has a populated value in the index of this character. 
If the current character ISN'T a child node of my current node add this character representation to the corresponding index location 
then set current node equal to the child that was added. However if the current character IS a child of the current node only 
set current node equal to the child. After evaluating the entire String the Node we left off on is marked as a word this allows 
our Trie to know which words exist in our "dictionary"
For search I simply navigate through the Trie if I discover the current character isn't in the Trie I return false.
After checking each Char in the String I check to see if the Node I left off on was marked as a word returning the result.
Starts with is identical to search except it doesn't matter if the Node I left off was marked as a word or not if entire string evaluated 
i always return true;
